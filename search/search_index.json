First, a vector embedding model is used to create an index of all objects in the Gramps database in the form of numerical vectors that encode the objects' meaning. This process is similar to the creation of the full-text search index, but more computationally expensive.</p> <p>Next, when a user asks a question via the chat enpoint, that question is converted to a vector as well, by the same embedding model,  and compared the objects in the Gramps database.
